This program is a two player Connect4 game I created using the Java GUI Library.

In order to play the game a user must
1) Click the JApplet/Screen to place the token on the board
2) Once a player gets four tokens in a row or the board is filled with no winner, the game ends
3) Players can decide to play again or call it quits!
